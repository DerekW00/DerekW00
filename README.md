## Hi there 👋
My name is Derui (Derek) Wang. 

I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2023, where I triple majored in Computer Science, Data Science, and Economics.

I specialize in building AI-powered backend systems and high-throughput APIs. From architecting concurrent risk-scoring engines achieving sub-500ms response times to building autonomous AI agents with LangGraph and DSPy—I thrive where systems thinking meets practical engineering.

What drives me is creating software that doesn't just work—it scales. Whether I'm building ML-powered KYB verification systems or designing event-driven architectures for real-time data processing, I approach each challenge with equal parts technical precision and creative problem-solving. I get excited about shaving milliseconds off API response times and designing systems that handle millions of records efficiently.
